4. Rules=Only the impostors can vent using vents. They can kill the crew mates. Only they know who the impostors are. They can't complete tasks but can fake that they are doing them in order to fool the crew mates. Only the crew mates can complete tasks. They crew mates don't know who the impostor is.
5. Balancing= The crew mates can vote the impostor out and the impostor can kill the crew mates.
6.  Adaptivity= The mor you become the impostor the more adicting the game is. And the more you get crew mates the more games you play in order to get impostors.
